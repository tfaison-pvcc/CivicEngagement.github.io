  <h1> Problems With Planned Obsolescence</h1>
  
  <body>
    <h2>Intro</h2>
    <p>Planned obsolescence is a problem that is infecting not only the tech industry but everything from cars and trucks to light bulbs and washing machines.  </p>
  
    <h2>Essay Body </h2>
    <p>For example in our country we have light bulbs with 2 filaments and they’re made to expire within a few months of use because we have no consumer protections about planned obsolescence but if we look at a country like the United Arab Emirates all of their lightbulbs are 8 filaments if not more and can last upwards of a year if not more due to the fact they have some protections around stuff like this. Planned obsolescence is not useful at all for the consumer and should bring on antitrust lawsuits. It is anti consumer and only exists  just to line the pockets of the world's richest companies even more. Another example of planned obsolescence is when Apple started updating their older phones with updates that purposefully slowed them down and greatly reduced the lifespan of their own products so they can increase their profits. In fact Apple was sued by the French government in 2017 for over 25 Million euros for purposefully slowing them down. Apple blamed it on the lithium ion batteries losing their overall charge overtime which resulted in them trying to slow the phone down to increase their lifespan. Now usually with phones you can replace the battery which wouldn’t be a problem if Apple didn’t make repairing their phones also insanely anti consumer down to needing certain parts having to match the exact serial number of the phone or else it won’t work. Because of this lawsuit Apple now had to display a warning on their website. As you can see from my examples above, planned obsolescence just decreases the lifespan of consumer electronics making you have to replace a $1000 phone even sooner. Now from personal experience in my own life my grandparents had the same fridge for 30 years and it worked great and one day they decided to finally replace it and after only about 2-3 years they had to replace it due to them being cheaply made now so that they break right after the warranty period ends. This isn’t speculation either, brands like Whirlpool which we had got sued for this exact process in a class action lawsuit where they had to pay 21.33 Million USD. Refrigerators, washing machines, and dryers are insane things to cheap out on because if a dryer breaks unexpectedly it could literally burn your entire house down. We should be holding these manufacturers to a higher level of quality with guaranteed life cycles in the double digits I’m talking 10-15+ years for stuff like that. People like Louis Rossman have been advocating for years to try and move the needle on planned obsolescence and the right to repair. But it will never happen in the current state of our government where lobbyist groups have more power than the actual voting people and can shell out millions upon millions of dollars to get into our house representative and senators pockets it even goes up to the supreme court with corrupt judges like Clarence Thomas taking millions of dollars in gifts and vacations from these sorts of people. </p>

    <h2>My Conclusion</h2>
    <p>So in conclusion planned obsolescence is a legal criminal scheme ran by these fortune five hundred companies so they can suck our pockets dry like the money hungry vampires they are. It harms the consumer through and through and should not be allowed it only exists to screw us the consumer over so they can line their pockets even more than they already are. </p>
